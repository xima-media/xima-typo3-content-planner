Assignee
=======================

For every content planner record, an assignee can be set. The assignee is the person responsible for the record.

..  note::
    If the :ref:`auto assignment <extconf-autoAssignment>` feature is enabled, the current user will be set as assignee when a new status is set to the record.

The assignee can be set in the edit form of the record in the "Content Planner" tab.

    If the :ref:`current assignee highlight <extconf-currentAssigneeHighlight>` feature is enabled, records assigned to the current user will be highlighted in a light yellow color.
