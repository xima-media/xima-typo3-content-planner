## Usage

### Status

By default they are four different default status available:

- *Pending*: The page is not yet ready for editing.
- *In progress*: The page is currently being edited.
- *Needs review*: The page is ready for review.
- *Completed*: The page is ready to be published.

> **Hint**: The status are content generated on the root page. Add/remove/adjust them to fit your needs.

Change the page status easily:

- In the "Content Planner" tab within the page properties
- In the page tree context menu
- In the page backend header

Assign a user to the page to distribute the content work. >our own assignment is highlighted in the dashboard.

> **Hint**: By default the auto assignee feature is enabled. The assignee is automatically set to the current user when the status is changed from stateless to a new state.

Configure the auto assignee feature and more in the extension settings.

Add some helpful comments within the page to support the content work.

## Configuration

Feature toggles are available, see `ext_localconf.php` for configuration options.

The content planner abilities are part of a **custom permission** and needed to be granted to the dedicated user group/s (except admins).

Every user can easily disable the content planner features in the user settings to avoid colour overload.

## Command

Use the bulk update command to process multiple entities at once. See help for more information regarding the specific usage.

```bash
vendor/bin/typo3 content-planner:bulk-update --help
```

## Additional record tables

If you want to extend the content planner to other record tables (e.g. news), follow the steps below:

1. Extend the TCA (e.g. `Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tx_news_domain_model_news.php`):

```php
\Xima\XimaTypo3ContentPlanner\Utility\ExtensionUtility::addContentPlannerTabToTCA('tx_news_domain_model_news');
```

2. Extend the database fields (`ext_tables.sql`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE tx_news_domain_model_news
(
    tx_ximatypo3contentplanner_status   int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
    tx_ximatypo3contentplanner_assignee int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
    tx_ximatypo3contentplanner_comments int(11) unsigned default '0' not null,
);
```

3. Register the table in the `ext_localconf.php`:

```php
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['xima_typo3_content_planner']['registerAdditionalRecordTables'][] = 'tx_news_domain_model_news';
```

## Events

This extension provides several events to hook into the content planner functionality.

- [StatusChangeEvent](Classes/Event/StatusChangeEvent.php)
- [PrepareStatusSelectionEvent.php](Classes/Event/PrepareStatusSelectionEvent.php)

## Development

Use the following ddev command to easily install all support TYPO3 versions.

```bash
ddev install all
```

The setup command adds the status functionality for testing purposes to `sys_category` and `tt_content`.

```bash
ddev setup
ddev setup reset
```
